# Predictive-Maintenance-IoT
Using a Machine learning system with IoT sensors to measure the sensor data precisely and forecast maintenance of the equipment can reduce error rates and can save the business money.  Instead of setting equipment parameters manually, one can make different measurements using sensors. Considering the sensor data and the past levels of air pollution in the area for the previous 'x' number of days, we are going to forecast and schedule maintenance of the air filters.  We will deploy this as a working application which would analyse the data coming in at regular intervals and predict the pollution level, which shall then be used to decide when to replace the air filters. This will help us understanding creating a pipeline to work with IoT data.
